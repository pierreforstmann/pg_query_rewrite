08-JUN-2021 - v0.0.2

This release supports rule scope at database level:
- a rule is only valid in database used when rule is added
- pgqr_rules() displays all rules for all databases with datname field defining database scope.

SQL translation rule is also tested in procedural SQL and should work.

Limitation about SQL statement using parameters has been added to README.
