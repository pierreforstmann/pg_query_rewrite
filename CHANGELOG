08-JUN-2021 - v0.0.2

This release supports rule scope at database level:
- a rule is only valid in database used when rule is added
- pgqr_rules() displays all rules for all databases with datname field defining database scope.

SQL translation rule in procedural SQL is also tested and should work.

Error message 'relcache reference leak: relation "..." not closed' has been fixed.

Limitation about SQL statement using parameters has been added to README.
