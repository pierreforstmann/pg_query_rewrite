FEBRUARY 2023 - v0.0.5

- default setting for pg_query_rewrite.max_rules is set to 10 to fix bug found in issue #1.
- pgqr_truncate_rules is renamed to pgqr_truncate_rule.

- code has been modified so that test3 does not fail against PG 10 and PG 11.
- test8 has been added to test character strings as literals and pgqr_remove_rule.

08-JUN-2021 - v0.0.2

This release supports rule scope at database level:
- a rule is only valid in database used when rule is added
- pgqr_rules() displays all rules for all databases with datname field defining database scope.

SQL translation rule in procedural SQL is also tested and should work.

Error message 'relcache reference leak: relation "..." not closed' has been fixed.

Limitation about SQL statement using parameters has been added to README.
